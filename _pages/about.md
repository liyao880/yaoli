I am an assistant professor of Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill. I was a Ph.D. student at UC Davis working with [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/index.html) and [Prof. Thomas Lee](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~tcmlee/). I received my master degree in London School of Economics and Political Science under supervision of Prof. Piotr Fryzlewicz. 

My research focuses on developing new algorithms to resolve the real-world difficulties in the machine learning pipeline. I study both statistical and computational aspects of machine learning models. I am interested in developing new models with statistical guarantees, such as recommeder systems, factorial machine and fiducial inference. Currently, I am working on adversarial examples, trying to improve the robustness of deep neural networks.

**I'm looking for motivated students to work with me.**
