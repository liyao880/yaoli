This course is an application-driven introduction to data science. Statistical and computational tools are valued throughout the modern workplace from Silicon Valley startups, to marine biology labs, to Wall Street firms. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking.

You will learn these tools and hone these skills through hands-on experience working with datasets provided in class and downloaded from certain public websites. During the first part of the semester, we will focus on R programming skills and data visualization. Later topics will include: exploratory data analysis, web scraping, data wrangling, modeling, and effective communication of results.

Plan to come to every class with your computer and ready to work with others. Using resources around you is a key component of successful data analysis. This includes the internet and people.
