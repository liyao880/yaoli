title: "Robustness for statistical model"
collection: research
---

Studies have showed that machine learning models, not only neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although adversarial robustness have been extensively studied in the context of neural networks, research on this issue in many other machine learning and statistical models and how to make these models robust against adversarial examples is still limited. It is thus interesting to study how to attack and defend these models.
