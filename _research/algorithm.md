Another line of research I would like to continue working on is designing models with better statistical guarantees. In previous works, we developed efficient and scalable machine learning and statistical models to solve real-world problems. There are many problems remain unsolved in this field, such as better ranking models with statistical guarantee, more ''fair'' machine learning models in dealing with biased data and so on.
