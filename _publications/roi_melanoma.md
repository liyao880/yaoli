Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact in clinical practice. Here, we propose a patch-based region of interest detection method for melanocytic skin tumor whole slide images. Our data set comprises of 161 primary melanomas and nevi H&E whole slide images. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised ROI detection methods leading to better model visualization and interpretation.
