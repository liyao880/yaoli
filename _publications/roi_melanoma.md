Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact in clinical practice. 
%In this paper, we aim to address one important question: How to perform automated region of interest detection in melanocytic skin tumor ({\it melanoma} and {\it nevus}) whole slide images?
Here, we propose a patch-based region of interest detection method for melanocytic skin tumor whole slide images.
%We work with a dataset that contains $161$ melanocytic skin tumor images, including {\it melanomas} (skin cancer) and {\it nevi} (benign moles), and propose a patch-based region of interest detection method, which achieves better performance than other unsupervised and supervised methods on the melanocytic skin tumor images.
Our data set comprises of $161$ primary {\it melanomas} and {\it nevi} H$\&$E whole slide images. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised ROI detection methods leading to better model visualization and interpretation.
